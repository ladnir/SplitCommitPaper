\section{Tutorial}

Giving read code examples here could be good. I was thinking we could show how to set of networking, and a single two thread program that commits to 100 values or something.

We should also show how to perform homomorphic operations on them.

Then we can add batch decommit to the mix.

Finally, show how to handle chosen message with homomorphic operations on them.
