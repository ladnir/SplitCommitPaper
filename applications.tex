\section{Applications}

Here we can talk about applications that have used split commit such as LEGO/DUPLO. Do we know of any others?


We can then talk about how this is a valid UC commitment and that split commit is insteresting as a stand along commitment in the standard model.

Finally, we can compare to RO commitments. Then is that actually better and then worse.

 - Better for random messages of size ~128 bits\\
 - Comparable for chosen message of size 128 bits\\
 - Better for small decommitments\\
 - Worse for long messages\\
 - Worse interactive commitment.\\
 - SplitCommit can use FiatShamir to get non interactive with small comm.
